          A true penthouse stands out through its unique architectural design and exclusive features that elevate it
          above other residences. Penthouses for sale often include open-air terraces and floor-to-ceiling windows
          offering breathtaking views.

        <p class="text-muted mb-4">The term "penthouse" refers to a high-end unit that is situated at the top of a
          building. However, not all top-floor spaces qualify as penthouses. A true penthouse is characterized by its
          distinct architectural design and exclusive features that is different from other units. </p>
