          <p class="text-muted mb-4">
            Real estate agents play an important role in finding the perfect penthouse. Real estate agents offer
            valuable market insights, access to exclusive listings, and help you through the legal complexities of
            property transactions. Be careful with unauthorized agents who pressure you to make a quick decision. Always
            ensure your agent is RERA-certified and has a solid reputation in the Dubai real estate market.
