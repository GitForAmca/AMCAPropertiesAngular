        <h2>Townhouses for sale in Dubai</h2>
        <p class="text-muted mb-4">
          A townhouse is a multi-level home that’s part of a row of attached residences sharing common walls. Unlike
          apartments, townhouses often feature a private entrance, giving residents great independence and a sense of
          home-like privacy. Explore the best townhouses for sale in Dubai here that offer modern designs and
          exceptional investment potential.

          include access to schools, healthcare facilities, shopping centers, recreational areas, and convenient public
          transportation.
